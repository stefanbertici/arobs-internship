# arobs-internship

This repository contains all of the exercise problems that I have worked on in the first 4 weeks of the internship programme and the graduation project itself, "Musify", which I have worked on in the latter half of the programme.

Musify is a service for listening to music. We have implemented the administrative part of it, not the streaming itself.

That being said, the app can do the following:
 - manage users (register new users, login, update, inactivate a user);
 - manage artists (create, update);
 - manage songs, albums (create/update);
 - manage playlists (create/update/delete);
 - have a search capability for searching artists, albums, songs;
 - the users are be able to:
 - get the list of playlists they have or follow;
 - add/remove songs to playlists; change order of songs;
 - get the list of songs for a playlist;
 - load all albums of an artist; load all songs for an album.
